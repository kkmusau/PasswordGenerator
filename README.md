# Password Generator

## Task

 The task was to complete a passcode generator that could include an array of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters. The user would be prompted with a series of questions that fit the following password criteria:

- The password was betweem 8 and 128 characters
- The user could choose if the password contained lowercase letters
- The user could choose if the password contained uppercase letters
- The user could choose if the password contained any numbers
- The user could choose if the password contained any special characters

In the prompt window, if the user selected a number less than 8 or more than 128, they would receive an alert message to try again and the user would be directed back the the prompt question to input a valid response. 

The user can then confirm with an "ok" or "cancel" whether or not the desired password should contain a lowercase character, an uppercase character, a number and/or a special character. Once the user completed the confirmations, a password would then be generated successfully.
